# Midterm Case Study | E-Commerce Application

## Objective:
- Develop the UI/UX of your e-commerce web application using React js, following the sprint plan you created during the Prelim phase.

- Each team member must actively contribute to the project using Git by creating individual branches, making commits, and submitting pull requests to demonstrate effective collaboration and version control.

## Reflection:
Each member should answer briefly in the documentation:
1. What part of the UI did you develop or design?
2. What challenges did you encounter using Git for collaboration?
3. How does your part contribute to the overall user experience?
4. What improvements can be made to the interface or user flow?

### NOTE!!
Kindly do it neatly and add comments. Thank you
